## Connections: 

- How are benefits and costs distributed spatially, temporally, and socioeconomically? 
- How are culture, politics, and environment (among others) affected by this project? Are those effects included in the consequences of the project? 
- Is the success of the project tied to the success of other projects outside the scope of the immediate evaluation? 
- What are the modeling interconnections (that is, what model input must be generated using other models, such as climate model data into hydrologic models, and hydrologic model data into systems models)?
- What are the scheduling interconnections (that is, what other projects must be completed before this project can begin, and what other projects must wait for this project to be completed)?
- Is there wide agreement on the projectâ€™s interconnections?
