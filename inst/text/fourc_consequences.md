## Consequences: 

- What are the project’s benefits and costs, or are other performance indicators primary? 
- How are benefits and costs distributed spatially, temporally, and socioeconomically? 
- How are the project’s benefits and costs measured? 
- Can all benefits and costs be monetized? 
- What are the performance thresholds, that is, the criteria for designation as failure or success? 
- What are the windfall possibilities (best case), and what are the worst-case consequences of failure? 
- How might failures be hedged against? 
- Is it possible to assign likelihoods on future scenarios? How might those be
quantified and analyzed? 
- Is there wide agreement on the consequences of the project?
