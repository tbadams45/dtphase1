## unCertainties 

- What are the principal uncertainties (1) in the short term (for example, climate, demographic, economic, and political factors) and (2) in the long term (that is, after the first 10-20 years)?
- Are the uncertainties the result of lack of data or lack of observations, or are they largely irreducible? 
- If the uncertainties can be reduced, how much effort and budget would be required to reduce these uncertainties? 
- Can decisions on the project be delayed until more information is gathered? 
- Is data collection obstructed by matters of national security or secrecy of another kind? 
- How do the uncertainties interact? 
- How might the various uncertainties (principal and minor) be weighted? 
- Are the uncertainties fairly well understood and quantifiable, or would they be better described as “deep”? 
- If trends in available data are discernible, what do the trends indicate, and how well do the historical trends match the projections? 
- Do the various stakeholders agree on the relative significance of the uncertainties? 
- Can a probability distribution be fitted to the uncertainties? Can they be modeled statistically?
