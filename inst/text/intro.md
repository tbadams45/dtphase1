## Overview

Welcome to Phase 1 of the Decision Tree Framework: the Climate Screening Worksheet. This
worksheet will help you determine if the project under consideration requires a
Phase 2 analysis.

The first and most important component to completing Phase 1 is a thoughtful
reflection and analysis of your project. The Four C's provide strategic
questions to guide your thinking. You are encouraged to add or remove particular
questions based on their relevance to the project.

After you have spent some time reflecting on the project, fill out the basic
questions at the bottom of this page to determine whether or not the project
requires a Phase 2 sensitivity analysis. You can then download this page, along
with your responses, for your records.
